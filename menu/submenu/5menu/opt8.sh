In quantum chemistry, the electron localization function (ELF) is a measure
of the likelihood of finding an electron in the neighborhood space of a reference electron
located at a given point and with the same spin. Physically, this measures the extent of
spatial localization of the reference electron and provides a method for the mapping of
electron pair probability in multielectronic systems.
