This module is used to introduce how to use Wannier Koopmans Method (WKM) to calculate electronic
structure based on Koopmans theorem. Several tests on LDA calculations have been applied on common
covalence semiconductor, ionic crystals and organic crystals. The band gap results agree well with
experiments gaps.（使用WKM方法计算电子结构， 对普通共价半导体，离子晶体和有机晶体都有很好的效果，对含d电子的体系还需要优化）
