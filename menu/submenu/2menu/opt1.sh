This module is the interface between PWmat and the Alloy-Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT).
ATAT is a generic name that refers to a collection of alloy theory tools,
which can be used to generate Special Special Quasirandom structures (SQS), model disordered solid solutions,
construct cluster expersions from first-priciples, perform Monte Carlo simulation of lattice models
in order to compute thermodynamic properties of alloys,
starting from a cluster expansion, ...（与ATAT软件的接口，可以进行SQS建模等）
