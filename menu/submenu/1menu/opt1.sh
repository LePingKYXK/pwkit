This module is the interface between PWmat and CALYPSO，
CALYPSO is an efficient structure prediction method and its same-name compute software.

The approach requires only chemical compositions for a given compound to predict stable or
metastable structures at given external conditons, thus the CALYPSO package can be used to
predict/determine the crystal structure and design the multi-functonal materials.（可用于结构搜索）
