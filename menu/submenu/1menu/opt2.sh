This module is the interface between PWmat and USPEX.
USPEX is is a method developed by the Oganov laboratory since 2004,
which allows to predict crystal structure with arbitrary P-T conditions by knowing only chemical
composition of the material. In addition to crystal structure prediction,
USPEX can work in other dimensionalities and predict the structure of nanoparticles, polymers,
surfaces, interfaces and 2D-crystals.（结构搜索软件USPEX的接口）
