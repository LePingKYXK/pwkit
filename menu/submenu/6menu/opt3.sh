This module is the interface between PWmat and phonon3py. Phonon3py can be used to calculate
phonon-phonon interaction and related properties using the supercell approach,
including lattice thermal conductivity, Phonon lifetime/linewidth and Imaginary
part of self energy.（与phononpy的接口，计算晶格热导率，声子寿命/线宽等）
