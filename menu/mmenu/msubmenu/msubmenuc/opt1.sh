This module is used to introduce how to use PWmat to calculate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, water splitting), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, fuel cell), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, water splitting). It includes how to calculate the Gibbs free energies of the intermediate states and the volcano curve crossing different catalysis.（几种常见的催化计算，OER/ORR/HER等）
