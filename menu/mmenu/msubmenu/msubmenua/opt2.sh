Born effective charge is the coefficient of proportionality between a change in macroscopic polarisation in direction j caused by an atomic displacement in direction i under conditions of zero external field, which quantifies the coupling between optical phonons and electric fields. In this module, we calculate the born charge with berry phase approach.（用berry phase方法计算born effective charge）
