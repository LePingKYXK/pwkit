Raman spectroscopy is a powerful noninvasive technique for material characterization that uniquely
extracts information about vibrational and chemical properties, inhomogeneities, strain,
crystallinity, electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicities in a local environment.
Here we can obtain raman spectrum with gaussians broadening.（非共振拉曼）
