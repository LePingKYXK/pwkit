This module is used to introduce how to use PWmat to calculate the ionization cross section by high energy electron beam. Cross section means the probability of electron-impact ionization. This moudle uses a general model called Binary-Encounter-Dipole (BED) model to calculate the cross section of the process of a electron-impact ionization. This cross section describes the process when another electron from the material has been kicked out from the material into the vacuum.（计算电离截面）
