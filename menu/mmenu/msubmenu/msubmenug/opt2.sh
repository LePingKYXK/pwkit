This module is used to introduce how to calculate auger decay rate (the probaility of Auger Effect) in an isolated system (molecule or quantum dot) using PWmat. Auger process is a process through Coulomb interaction, while one electron falls down from a higher energy level to lower energy level, the energy is transferred to another electron, which is excited from one lower energy state to a higher energy state. This module focus on ionization, which means the final state is an state in vacuum.（计算俄歇复合））
