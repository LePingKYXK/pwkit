This module is used to introduce how to use rt-TDDFT to simulate ultrafast dynamics, including the dynamics after a system suddenly loses an electron (e.g., due to femtosecond laser beam caused ionization); or exciting one electron from valence band to one conduction band state; a collision of a very fast ion…（TDDFT算载流子冷却）
