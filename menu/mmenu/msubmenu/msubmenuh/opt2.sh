This module is used to introduce what is CPM, and what CPM can be userd for their researches. CPM is one general approach to calculate large nanosystems, It generates the charge density (hence the DFT Hamiltonian) of a large system from small system calculations. It also consists of a set of methods to calculate the electronic structure of the large system Hamiltonian. In short, if you are calculating nanostructures with thousands, or tens of thousands of atoms, especially for their electronic and optical properties, or even dynamic behavior, then CPM will be useful.（CPM方法的功能介绍）
