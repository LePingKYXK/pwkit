Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF) platform aims at generating force fields with accuracy comparable to Ab Initio DFT molecular dynamics. It provides 8 types of features with translation, rotation, and permutation invariance. It also supports 4 engines for training and prediction, which are: 1. Linear Model 2. Nonlinear VV Model 3. Kalman Filter-based Neural Netowrk (KFNN) 4. Kalman Filter-based Deep Potential Model(KFDP)EOF
