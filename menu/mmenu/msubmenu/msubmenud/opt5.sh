This module is used to calculate Anomalous Hall Conductivity using PWmat and wannier90. The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has played an important role in the investigation and characterization of itinerant electron ferromagnets. Karplus and Luttinger pioneered the theoretical investigation of this effect, by showing how spin-orbit coupling in Bloch bands can give rise to an Anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in ferromagnetic crystals.（使用pwmat+wannier90计算反常霍尔电导）
