This module is introduced to how to calculate the formation energies of charged defects in both three-dimensional bulk and low-dimensional semiconductors by transfer to real state model (TRSM), which can overcome both conceptual ambiguity and computational difficulty, especially for low-dimensional semiconducting materials caused by “jellium model.（计算低维结构的带电缺陷，解决传统凝胶模型算低维缺陷能量发散问题）
