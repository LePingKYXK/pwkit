Charged-defect calculation using a periodic supercell is a significant class of problems in solid state physics. However, the finite supercell size induces an undesirable long-range image charge Coulomb interaction. we present a rigorous derivation of the image charge interaction with a defect screening model where the use of a bulk macroscopic dielectric constant can be avoided.（新的缺陷计算方法，解决超胞法中存在的长程库伦作用影响）
