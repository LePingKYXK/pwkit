Nonradiative carrier trapping at deep centers in semiconductors are of great importance for both fundamental physics and device engineering. This module is similar with module 13，we provided a novel algorithm to search for the classical transition barrier where the anharmonic effects are corrected by taking into account local phonon mode variation at different charge states of the defect.（非谐多声子非辐射跃迁）
