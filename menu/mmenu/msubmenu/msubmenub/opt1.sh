This module is used to calculate defect levels in semiconductors. Defect level in a crystal semiconductor means the defect energy level, especially relative to the bulk valence band maximum (VBM) or bulk conduction band maximum (CBM) positions. A typical diagram for defect levels represents as the formation energy as a function of Fermi energy. For different charge defect, the crossing point of two lines of different charge is the transition level.（计算半导体中的缺陷能级）
