This module is used to study the electronic band structure of disordered alloys and solid solutions
with a approximated disorder treatment. Compared to supercell approximation,
this module provide a much simpler and computationally less expensive approach.
By using this virtual crystal approximation (VCA) method,
one can easily compute the lattice constants and electronic structure of disordered
alloys and solid solutions. (虚晶近似模块，计算无序合金和固溶物体系的晶格常数、电子结构等性质)
